In the ever-evolving world of technology, one company stands out as the undisputed leader in the field of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs): Nvidia. With its hidden flagship product, the CUDA library, Nvidia has established itself as a formidable force in GPU programming and development. It creates a pull effect like a black hole. Here is why:

When you decide to invest in Nvidia’s GPUs, you are not merely purchasing hardware that can be easily replaced with a competitor’s product after a year. Instead, you are committing to a highly specialized software stack that requires a skilled team of developers to build and maintain. The CUDA library, Nvidia’s proprietary environment for optimized software development, is unparalleled in its efficiency and speed, outperforming other GPU programming languages with minimal development cycles.

CUDA has become the de facto standard for GPU programming, even being taught at universities worldwide. As Nvidia solidifies its dominance year after year, more engineers will be trained to program GPUs using the Nvidia methodology. However, this does not mean that competitors will emerge easily.

The importance of CUDA in the development process is evident when considering the energy consumption of datacenters worldwide. A mere 2x improvement in efficiency can make the difference between consuming the electricity of all Germany or just Sweden. Replacing a Nvidia GPU necessitates rebuilding the software stack from scratch, requiring specialized engineers with expertise in CUDA to achieve comparable performance. This process is time-consuming, uncertain, and costly.

The only reason to undertake such a challenge would be if a competitor’s chip were at least 10x faster and more efficient than Nvidia’s offerings. But who would build such a chip? TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturing company, is already fully booked by Nvidia.

In conclusion, Nvidia’s dominance in the GPU market stems from its proprietary CUDA library and the highly specialized software stack it requires. With TSMC’s exclusive deal with Nvidia, competitors face an uphill battle to challenge the company’s leadership in this field. As long as Nvidia maintains its dominance, investors can be confident that their hardware is not only cutting-edge but also future-proof.
